# Getting started with GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is a generative AI pair programmer. As you code, context including open files in the IDE, comments and code are sent to GitHub Copilot. Suggestions are then returned based on what it sees and what it knows for the next line or lines of code you're most likely looking for. To do so an extension is needed for your IDE.

## Install the extension

GitHub Copilot has extensions for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NeoVIM and the JetBrains suite of IDEs. Because the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code for Codespaces is, well, Visual Studio Code, you can install the extension!

1. Open the command pallette by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd>.
2. In the command pallette window, type **Install extensions**.
3. Select **Extensions: Install extensions**.
4. Type **GitHub Copilot** in the newly opened extensions window.
5. Select **Install** on **GitHub Copilot** to install the extension.
6. If prompted, reconnect to the codespace.
